# Redux-Toolkit

* Redux Toolkit is a state management library used in frontend library and framework like ReactJS and Angular
* Passing the data through different component via prob drilling is become much difficult when the application get bigger
* So, here we use state management library like redux to access data in every component we want


This project is minimal version to showcase of how the state management library like redux work.
